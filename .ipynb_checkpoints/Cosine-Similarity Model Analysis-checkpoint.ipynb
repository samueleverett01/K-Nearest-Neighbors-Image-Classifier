    "# Analysis of Cosine-Similarity Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, a parsimonious version of K-Nearest Neighbors (dubbed Cosine-Similarity Model) is proposed that results in a slightly higher accuracy than standard K-Nearest Neighbor models, along with a 2 times (or greater) classification speedup.  The models's speed and accuracy is a reminder that building in-house models is often the best option when solving specific problems, as opposed to using pre-built models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standard K-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) algorithms are simple supervised classification algorithms that have the capability of making accurate predictions on complex problems.  K-NN is a lazy learner, so it requires no training and can thus get right to classification, making it a much faster algorithm than other classification models such as SVM, regression, multi-layer perceptron, etc..  K-NN is also non-parametric, so it makes to assumptions about the data.  Because the algorithm requires no training, data can be added or taken away seamlessly, without making any major adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a point $p$ to classify, a K-NN model will \"compare\" the passed point with each point $x_i$ the model has available to it, using some distance metric (most commonly Euclidean distance).  This process will generate the unordered set $D$ that holds the distances (similarities) between $p$ and every other point in the dataset, $x_i$, giving $d_i$.  Next, the algorithm pulls the $k$ lowest distances (greatest similarities) from $D$, and uses some voting technique to classify $p$ as being a member of some class $C$.  See [this](https://importq.wordpress.com/2017/11/24/mnist-analysis-using-knn/) tutorial for a more thorough description of K-NN.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Cosine-Similarity Model\n",
    "The Cosine-Similarity Model works in the same general way as most K-NN classifiers.  The primary difference with the Cosine-Similarity Classifier is in its name: it uses cosine-similarity as a distance metric instead of standard Euclidean or Manhatten distance (which are far more common then cosine similarity).  Cosine-similarity is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "similarity=cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}}{||\\vec{a}|| ||\\vec{b}||}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ are vectors whos similarity is returned.  Cosine similarity is often not a perfect distance metric, as it doesn't work on negative data, and violates the triangle inequality.  However for certain problems (as shown below) it is a solid choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "After testing the Cosine-Similarity Model on the MNIST data set, it is found that the Cosine-Similarity classifier is both faster and just as, if not more accurate than go-to K-NN models from the Scikit-Learn library.  In the analysis below, I will build out the Cosine-Similarity Model, and run it on the MNIST data set.  I will then test a go-to K-NN model from Scikit-Learn on the MNIST dataset, finally comparing both the accuracy and classification time of the two models in a variety of situations.  All tests were run on a Intel Core 3570K CPU (no GPU this time :( ).\n",

    "As shown by the test results, the Cosine-Similarity Model is significantly faster (about 45 times faster in this example) at classifying single points than its corresponding Scikit-Learn classifier for larger stored data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Although I cannot speak as to why the Cosine-Similarity Model is generally more accurate than the Scikit-Learn K-NN model, it is likely faster because the Scikit-Learn model is far more complex.  The Scikit-Learn model takes many more arguments, adding complexity to the classification task, so it takes more time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The main lesson learned from this project is, depending on the problem being solved, it may be best to make an algorithm in-house instead of using pre-built algorithms, as these pre-built algorithms are meant to work well across a wide variety of situations, and are not optimized for just one problem.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Room For Improvement\n",
    "Below are some points that can be used in the improvement of the Cosine-Similarity Model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current Cosine-Similarity Model uses a brute force approach to classifying input data, where each point to be classified has its distance computed with each other point in the model's stored data set.  This current brute force approach scales as $O(DN^2)$ for $D$ dimensions and $N$ samples.  To address this massive computational inefficiency, one of the many tree based data structures could be implemented into the model, greatly reducing the number of distance calculations made for each data point, furthur reducing classification complexity to $O[DN\\text{log}(N)]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the current Cosine-Similarity Model, each of the $k$ points used for voting are equally weighted.  While the optimal voting approach used for classification varies from problem to problem, it would be worth experimenting with other weighted voting methods.  Using cross validation to find the optimal $k$/weight \"setting\" for each problem would be worth the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lessons Learned & Moving Forward\n",
    "Below is a list of the primary takeaways from the project, and possible future applications of the model.\n",
    "* One of the greatest characteristics about K-NN is its simplicity.  The Cosine-Similarity Model, an incredibly simple model, out performs some standard convolutional neural networks accuracy wise.  This demonstrates the beauty of simple, parsimonious models, that seem to have been largely overlooked lately with the incredibly performance of deep learning.\n",
    "* Cosine similarity is often not used as it tends to violate the triangle inequality and does not work on negative data.  However, as this analysis proves, cosine similarity holds its own in certain problems, as it is generally both accurate and efficient.\n",
    "* The results from this model are by no means state of the art, however they do show that proprietary algorithms often perform quite well on specific problems.\n",
    "* I doubt the Cosine-Similarity Model will generalize well to more complex image classification tasks.  However, using techniques such as max pooling in more complex image classification tasks may help improve the model's accuracy.  \n",
    "* In future projects, I would like to incorporate weighted voting, tree data structures, and cross-validation into the development of the model.\n",
